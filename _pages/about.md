## ðŸŒ¸ A Journey Through Curiosity and Courage

I was born and raised in the lively lanes of Delhi, India, a city that dances with history, food, and fierce ambition. I spent my undergraduate years at the University of Delhi, where I fell in love with mathematics not just as a subject, but as a way of thinking. Those college days were some of the happiest â€” sipping chai with friends between lectures, solving problems late into the night, and learning how to ask better questions.

After graduation, I moved to Nagpur to pursue my Masterâ€™s in Mathematics at VNIT. The shift from Delhiâ€™s chaos to Nagpurâ€™s calm was not just geographical â€” it was deeply personal. I learned to live independently, to navigate doubts, and to trust myself even when the next step felt unclear. It was during this time that I first stumbled upon the beauty of Bayesian thinking, and I knew I had found something I wanted to explore more deeply.

That curiosity carried me across continents â€” to Germany, where I began my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Potsdam. Leaving home wasnâ€™t easy, but what awaited was a journey filled with discovery, resilience, and an ever-growing love for Bayesian inference, uncertainty quantification, and mathematical modeling. I now work under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Sebastian Reich, building methods that sit at the intersection of theory and real-world impact.

Through it all â€” from Delhiâ€™s classrooms to Nagpurâ€™s libraries to the forested calm of Potsdam â€” Iâ€™ve been driven by a simple belief: to understand deeply, and to share generously.

This website is a little reflection of that. I hope it brings us closer â€” as fellow thinkers, researchers, or just curious souls. So grab a cup of coffee, take a look around, and if something resonates with you, letâ€™s talk.
