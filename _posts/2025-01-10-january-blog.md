Hello and thank you for stopping by!

I’m Diksha, a doctoral researcher in applied mathematics, and I’ve always believed that mathematics, at its core, is a language—one that can be understood by anyone when explained with clarity and purpose. Through this blog, I hope to share that belief with you.

My goal is simple, to make mathematical concepts whether abstract, applied, or computational more approachable and intuitive. Whether you're a fellow researcher, a student, or just someone curious about how math shapes our world, this space is for you.

You’ll find posts here on topics ranging from probability and Bayesian thinking to real world applications of mathematical models. Each entry is written with care to balance rigor with accessibility.

I hope you find something here that sparks your interest or clarifies a concept you've been grappling with. Let’s make math feel less like a hurdle and more like a conversation.
