## Research Projects

### 🔍 Ensemble Transform Methods for Neural Network Uncertainty
We propose ensemble transform methods that improve predictive uncertainty in neural networks. These methods are affine-invariant and applicable to any pre-trained network. The work uses ensemble transform Kalman filter-based MCMC methods for efficient posterior sampling and supports robustness against model misspecification.

### 🧠 Bayesian Inference of Human Language Comprehension
Applied ensemble Kalman methods to simulate and infer uncertainty in the **Sentence Gestalt model**, a neural network model of human language comprehension. We used a scoring-rule-based Bayesian formulation to handle model misfit and explored inference robustness in probabilistic psycholinguistic models.

### 🧪 Likelihood-Free Bayesian Inference with Scoring Rules
Developed novel sampling algorithms combining **kernel-based scoring rules** with ensemble transform MCMC samplers for high-dimensional generative models. Applications include **dynamical systems**, such as the stochastic Lorenz-96 model.

### 🌀 Centrifugal Compressor Design Optimization
Designed a 1D and 2D **Python-based compressor optimization tool** for centrifugal compressors. Used **genetic algorithms** to minimize aerodynamic losses and applied **Bayesian approaches** to surrogate modeling. Developed loss models, velocity triangle corrections, and efficiency estimation modules.
