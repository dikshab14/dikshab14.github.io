Welcome to my page! 

Iâ€™m **Diksha Bhandari**, a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at the University of Potsdam, Germany. I specialize in **Bayesian inference**, **data assimilation**, and **uncertainty-aware machine learning**, with a focus on developing robust, scalable methods for simulation-based models in both engineering and language.

My work integrates principles from applied mathematics, deep learning, and statistical inference to develop interpretable and trustworthy AI systems.
