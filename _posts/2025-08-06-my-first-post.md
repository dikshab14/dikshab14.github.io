Welcome to my blog! I'm Diksha Bhandari, a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Mathematics.

Here, I’ll be writing every week about topics I care deeply about:  
- Research updates  
- Applied math in real life  
- Machine learning techniques  
- Life as a doctoral researcher  
- Reflections and ideas  

Let's connect through ideas—and maybe even collaborate!
