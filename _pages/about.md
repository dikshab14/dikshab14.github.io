## A Journey through curiosity and courage

I was born and raised in the lively lanes of Delhi, India, a city that dances with history, food, and fierce ambition. I spent my undergraduate years at the University of Delhi, where I fell in love with mathematics not just as a subject, but as a way of thinking. Those college days were some of the happiest, sipping chai with friends between lectures, solving problems late into the night, and learning how to ask better questions.

After graduation from Delhi university, I moved to Nagpur to pursue my Master’s in Mathematics at VNIT, Nagpur. The shift from Delhi’s chaos to Nagpur’s calm was not just geographical, it was deeply personal. I learned to live independently, to navigate doubts, and to trust myself even when the next step felt unclear. It was during this time that I first stumbled upon the beauty of Bayesian thinking, and I knew I had found something I wanted to explore more deeply.

That curiosity carried me across continents to Germany, where I began my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Potsdam. Leaving home wasn’t easy, but what awaited was a journey filled with discovery, resilience, and an ever growing love for Bayesian inference, uncertainty quantification, and mathematical modeling. I now work under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Sebastian Reich, building methods that sit at the intersection of theory and real-world impact.

Through it all from Delhi’s classrooms to Nagpur’s libraries to the forested calm of Potsdam, I’ve been driven by a simple belief: to understand deeply, and to share generously.

This website is a little reflection of that. I hope it brings us closer — as fellow thinkers, researchers, or just curious souls. So grab a cup of coffee, take a look around, and if something resonates with you, let’s talk.
