Welcome to my blog — a space where I explore ideas at the intersection of **mathematics**, **machine learning**, and **real-world engineering**.

Every week, I share thoughts, insights, and deep-dives into topics ranging from **Bayesian inference** and **AI applications** to **compressor design** and **research life**. Whether you're an industry professional, a researcher, or just curious — I hope you find something here that inspires or informs you.

☕ Let’s think, question, and learn together. And if something sparks your interest, feel free to [connect](/contact/) — I’d love to hear your thoughts.
